# Experimental lithic reduction data

This dataset contains experimental lithic reduction sets produced by Sam Lin and was used in two published studies, Lin et al. (2015, 2016). 
Each nodule reduced has an unique CORE.ID and was knapped in sequential reduction EVENTS. Each EVENT consists of the knapper removing an arbitrary number of flakes from the nodule.
The raw material used was flint obtained from the Dordogne region of France, as well as Texas chert nodules purchased from online suppliers.
Knappers who helped created this dataset include Shannon McPherron, Will Archer, Dawit Desta and Marcel Weiss.
